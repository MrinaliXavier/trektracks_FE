# TrekTracks - AI-Powered Trail Generator App

Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

TrekTracks is an AI-powered mobile application that generates personalized hiking, biking, and running routes based on user preferences. Built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), this project was created with [create-expo-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Features

- *AI-Powered Route Generation*: Create customized trails based on difficulty level, terrain type, and scenic preferences
- *Offline Maps*: Access your routes even without internet connectivity
- *Community Sharing*: Discover and share routes with other outdoor enthusiasts
- *Real-time Weather Integration*: Stay informed about weather conditions on your chosen trails
- *Progress Tracking*: Monitor your fitness achievements and statistics
- *Cross-Platform Compatibility*: Available on iOS and Android devices

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trektracks.git
   cd trektracks
   

2. Install dependencies
   bash
   npm install
   

3. Start the app
   bash
   npm run dev
   

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the *app* directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Environment Setup

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:


API_KEY=your_api_key_here
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_api_key


## API Integration

TrekTracks integrates with several external APIs:
- MapBox for mapping and route visualization
- OpenWeather for real-time weather data
- Custom AI backend for route generation

## Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready to start from scratch, run:
bash
npm run reset-project


This command will move the starter code to the *app-example* directory and create a blank *app* directory where you can start developing.

## Testing

Run tests with:
bash
npm test


For end-to-end testing:
bash
npm run test:e2e


## Deployment

### Expo Build

To create a production build:
bash
expo build:android
expo build:ios


### EAS Build

For more advanced build configurations:
bash
eas build --platform android
eas build --platform ios
